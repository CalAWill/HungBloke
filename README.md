# HungBloke
A go at a classic hangman game in pygame with my own pixel art and code with no help from a tutorial (but still a little search for examples of code I need).

Its not finished just yet, heres a list of what needs to be done:
 - Switch between the different image stages of the hangman game
 - Maybe allow the player to enter the full word in one go
 - Make it so every 2 incorrect guesses adds another part to the hangman
